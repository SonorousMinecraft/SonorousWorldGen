**A procedural Voxel World generation Minecraft Plugin** 

*NOTE: This is not intended for usage anywhere else aside from the SereneOasis Minecraft server, this is open source for other developers to gain inspiration from*

(see https://github.com/Sujan-Naik/Minecraft-World-Generation if you want to fork a bare-bones version) 

## Features
> Intuitive and complex terrain generation, check out the link above to see elaborations on this

> Procedurally generated Kingdoms
- This is a step up from any previous attempt at populating the world with buildings, whether using mods or plugins
- Noise functions are used to create completely random yet extremely coherent Kingdoms
- Buildings used inside use Minecraft's vanilla structure system 
- This interacts with [SereneNPCs](https://github.com/SereneOasisMC/SereneNPCs) to populate the Kingdom
